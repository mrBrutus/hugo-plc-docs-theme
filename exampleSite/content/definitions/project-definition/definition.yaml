  File specifications for a *versioned project* using the `bdg-docs-theme`.

  - A *versioned project* is a set of files which will be **versioned and
    distributed as a whole**
  - It can contain one or more software libraries but also other files
  - Each library item (function, type) has its own versioning

  The project is defined by two files:

  - `project.yaml` *- Project definition file*
  - `_index.md` *- Markdown file used by Hugo*

  ```sh
  # File structure
  someProject
  |   project.yaml                # definition file for project `someProject`
  |   _index.md
  |
  \---someLib                     # directory for library `someLib`
      |   _index.md
      |
      +---functions
      |       someFunction.iecst  # source code for `someFunction`
      |       someFunction.md
      |       someFunction.yaml   # definition file for `someFunction`
      |       anotherFct.iecst
      |       anotherFct.md
      |       anotherFct.yaml
      |       _common.yaml        # common definitions (used by many functions)
      |       _index.md
      |
      \---types
              someType.md
              someType.yaml       # definition file for `someType`
              anotherType.md
              anotherType.yaml
              _common.yaml        # common definitions (used by many types)
              _index.md
  ```

  # Definition file

  This section specifies the content of the definition file.
